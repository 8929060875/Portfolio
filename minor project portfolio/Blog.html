                    <br>
                    <b> You went through many resources, but you still cannot understand JavaScript.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You’ve read through all the free resources you can find. You tried:
                    <br>
                        > Googling for web development articles
                        <br>
                        > Using beginner websites like CodeAcademy
                        <br>
                        > Going through FreeCodeCamp
                        <br>
                        > Reading books other developers recommend
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    You may have spent some money on learning JavaScript too.
                    <br>
                       >  You bought books and courses.
                        <br>
                       > You may even have spent $12,000 on a Bootcamp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each resource helped you understand some JavaScript, But you still can’t piece everything together — <i> you don’t know how to build things from scratch</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                     <b>When you try to code something from scratch, you freeze at a blank JavaScript file</b> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You twiddle your thumbs as you stare into the JavaScript file, but nothing comes to mind. <i>You don’t know how to start.</i> 
                    <br>
                    You realize one thing — <i>you don’t know JavaScript.</i> 
                    <br>
                    It’s frustrating, but you acknowledge there’s a gap in your knowledge.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>You lack confidence in JavaScript</b> 
                    <br>
                    
                    So you avoid JavaScript whenever you can. You rely on HTML and CSS — even resorting to hacky practices to avoid JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <i>This lack of confidence in JavaScript makes you nervous.</i>  You’re so nervous about JavaScript, you screw up on your interviews.
                    <br>
                    This lack of confidence also affects you on the job too:
                    <br>
                    > You don’t dare to say “yes” when you’re asked to use JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    > But you don’t want to say “no” either.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>You rely on Google when you need JavaScript</b> 
                    <br>

                    You look for libraries and plugins others have created. You hope they work, but you’re screwed if they don’t.
                    <br>
                    You copy-paste answers from Stack Overflow and various blogs you read. And you can’t understand what you copied.
                    <br>
                    You’re worried about being called out as a fraud.

                    <b>Deep down inside, you want think like a developer</b> 
                    <br>
                    If you know how to think like a developer, you can build anything you want! Nothing can stop you from building things:
                    <br>
                       > You won’t freeze up
                    <br>> You know exactly how to start and how to improve as you go along
                      <br> > Even if you get stuck, you can get yourself unstuck easily without Googling all the time.
                    <br>
                    You can solve any problem you encounter with JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    It’s a superpower.
                    <br>
                    <i>Thinking like a developer is simple.</i>  But it’s not easy. There are four steps:
                    <br>
                      1.  Identify the problem you need to solve
                     <br> 2.  Break the problem down into smaller problems
                   <br> 3. Solve each small problem
                     <br>  4. Assemble your solutions into the final solution.
                    <br>
                    The hardest part is knowing how to break large problems down into smaller problems.
